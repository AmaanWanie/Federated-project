#Federated Learning

This project implements a federated learning (FL) framework tailored for medical imaging datasets. The goal is to collaboratively train a robust convolutional neural network (CNN) model across multiple simulated clients (e.g., hospitals) while preserving data privacy. The project uses TensorFlow and integrates metadata from the COVID-19 Radiography Database to simulate the federated learning environment.
